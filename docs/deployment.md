# Deployment Structure and Data Flow

This document provides a conceptual overview of our deployment architecture and data flow, focusing on the Kubernetes and Istio-based setup. It is intended to help new contributors quickly understand the systemâ€™s structure, the roles of its components, and how requests flow through the cluster. For implementation details, see the [operation repository](https://github.com/remla2025-team9/operation).

## 1. **High-Level Architecture**

Our deployment consists of three main application components, monitoring infrastructure, and supporting Kubernetes/Istio resources:

- **App Frontend**: User-facing web application.
- **App Service**: Backend API, mediates between frontend and model.
- **Model Service**: Serves ML model predictions.
- **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and dashboards.
- **Istio Service Mesh**: Handles traffic management, security, and observability.
- **Persistent Storage**: For model cache.

**Other resources:**
- **ConfigMaps**: Grafana dashboards.
- **PersistentVolumes/Claims**: Model cache storage.
- **ServiceMonitors/PrometheusRules**: For monitoring and alerting.

This diagram illustrates the high-level architecture and data flow of our deployment, including the relationships between the app-frontend, app-service, model-service, and the Istio infrastructure.

## 3. **Kubernetes Resources Overview**

- **Deployments**: Each service (frontend, backend, model) is deployed as a Kubernetes Deployment, supporting multiple versions for experiments.
- **Services**: Expose each Deployment internally in the cluster.
- **PersistentVolumes/Claims**: Provide storage for model cache, ensuring model artifacts persist across pod restarts.
- **Secrets & ConfigMaps**: Store sensitive and non-sensitive configuration, injected into pods as environment variables or files.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana are deployed via Helm charts, with ServiceMonitors and dashboards configured for metrics collection and visualization.

## 4. **Istio Service Mesh Components**

- **Gateway**: Entry point for all external traffic into the cluster.
- **VirtualServices**: Define routing rules for HTTP traffic, enabling advanced traffic management.
- **DestinationRules**: Define subsets (v1, v2) for each service, enabling version-based routing and load balancing strategies.
- **EnvoyFilters**: Used for rate limiting.
- **Sidecar Injection**: All application pods have Istio sidecars enabling the service mesh.

## 5. **Request Flow and Dynamic Routing**

### **External Request Flow**

1. **User Request**: A user accesses the frontend via a DNS name (e.g., `app-frontend.k8s.local`).
2. **Gateway**: The request enters the cluster through the Istio Gateway.
3. **VirtualService Routing**: Istio routes the request to the appropriate frontend pod, potentially splitting traffic between versions (90% to v1, 10% to v2).
4. **Frontend to Backend**: The frontend calls the backend API (`app-service`) via its internal service name. Using VirtualServices, we ensure that the same version of the backend is used consistently for the frontend version.
5. **Backend to Model**: The backend calls the model service for predictions. The model service can also have multiple versions, and the backend uses VirtualServices to route requests to the appropriate model version.
6. **Response Propagation**: The response flows back through the same path to the user.

### **Dynamic Traffic Routing**

- **A/B Testing / Canary Releases**: VirtualServices and DestinationRules allow us to direct a percentage of traffic to different versions of a service (90% to v1, 10% to v2), enabling safe experimentation and gradual rollouts.
- **Header-Based Routing**: Some routes use HTTP headers (`x-user`) for consistent hashing, ensuring user sessions are sticky to a particular version.
- **Rate Limiting**: EnvoyFilters can enforce rate limits at the gateway level.

### **Monitoring and Observability**

- **Prometheus**: Scrapes metrics from all services and the Istio mesh.
- **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics and alerts, with dashboards for application and infrastructure health.
- **PrometheusRules**: Define alerts (e.g., high error rates, latency spikes).

---

## 6. **Experimental Design**

- **Multiple Versions**: Each service can have multiple versions (v1, v2) deployed simultaneously.
- **Traffic Splitting**: Istio VirtualServices control what percentage of traffic goes to each version, supporting controlled experiments.
- **Observability**: Metrics and dashboards allow us to monitor the impact of experiments in real time.
- **Persistence**: Model cache is shared via PersistentVolumes, ensuring consistent model state across deployments.
