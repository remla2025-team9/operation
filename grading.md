# Grading Self-Assessment

This document provides a self-assessment of our work for the Release Engineering course. Its purpose is to guide the grading process by clarifying our expected level of achievement for each rubric block, detailing where to find the implementation of specific requirements, and providing additional context for any solutions that might not be immediately obvious.

We have structured this document by assignment, with a subsection for each rubric block as defined in the course materials.

## Assignment 1

### Data Availability 

*   **Expected Level:** `Pass`
*   **Implementation:**
    - The GitHub organization follows the requested template
    - All relevant information is accessible
    - The `operation` folder contains the `grading.md` file
*   **Notes for the Grader:**

### Sensible Use Case 

*   **Expected Level:** `Pass`
*   **Implementation:**
    - The frontend allows querying the model
    - Additional interactions exist that allow users to change incorrect predictions
*   **Notes for the Grader:**

### Automated Release Process

*   **Expected Level:** `Excellent`
*   **Implementation:**
    - **(Excellent)** After every push to main (and thus also after merging branches to main), the pre-version tag is automatically bumped using a counter (e.g. from `v0.0.1-pre-2` to `v0.0.1-pre-3`). This gives support for multiple versions of the same pre-release.
    - **(Excellent)**   We have implemented a deployment workflow that is triggered manually with the click of a button in the GitHub Actions tab for all repositories. The bump level (patch, minor, major) can be set for this workflow when triggering manually. If the previous version was a pre-release, the pre-tag is removed for the stable release (e.g. for a patch bump, `v0.0.1-pre-2` will become `v0.0.1`, and for a minor bump, `v0.0.1-pre-2` will become `v0.1.0`).
    - **(Excellent)**   `app-frontend`, `app-service`, and `model-service` have a multi-stage Dockerfile.
    - **(Excellent)**   The images that are automatically released by `app-frontend`, `app-service`, and `model-service` support the `amd64` and `arm64` architectures.
*   **Notes for the Grader:**

### Software Reuse in Libraries

*   **Expected Level:** `Excellent`
*   **Implementation:**
    - **(Sufficient)** Both libraries provide a `setup.py` for packaging and installation. Installation is done via `pip` directly from the GitHub repositories, this installation method ensures that both libraries are included via regular package managers rather than being referenced locally.
    - **(Good)** The `lib-ml` repository contains core machine learning preprocessing logic, especially in the `preprocessing.py` module.  
    - **(Good)** The `model-service` repository imports the `preprocess` function directly from the `sentiment_analysis_preprocessing` package, which is the same preprocessing logic used during training. 
    - **(Good)** Retrieves version from Git metadata via `setuptools_scm`.
    - **(Excellent)** Model-service downloads model from external storage on startup:
        ```bash
        # In app/model_loader.py
        model_version = os.getenv("MODEL_VERSION")
        ```
    - **(Excellent)** Model is cached in a directory:
        ```bash
        # In app/model_loader.py
        model_path = f".cache/sentiment_pipeline-{model_version}.joblib"
        ```
*   **Notes for the Grader:**

### Exposing a Model via REST

*   **Expected Level:** `Excellent`
*   **Implementation:**
    - **(Sufficient)** Service is implemented using Flask and received REST requests.
    - **(Good)** The host and port of the Flask app are confiurable through an ENV variable.
    - **(Good)** Endpoints have OpenAPI specification.
    - **(Excellent)** The port is configurable.
*   **Notes for the Grader:**

### Docker Compose Operation

* **Expected Level:** Excellent  
* **Implementation:**  
  - **(Sufficient)** repository contains a docker-compose.yml that brings up app-service, model-service and app-frontend and makes app-service accessible from the host.  
  - **(Good)** defines a named volume model-cache for persistent caching.  
  - **(Good)** maps ports 5000:5000 for app-service and 3000:3000 for app-frontend.  
  - **(Good)** references the same container images as used in the Kubernetes deployment.  
  - **(Excellent)** each service has a `restart: on-failure` policy.  
  - **(Excellent)** Docker secret `example-secret` is defined under `secrets` and mounted into model-service.  
  - **(Excellent)** each service loads its own `env_file` for configuration.  
* **Notes for the Grader:**

    - **(Good)** The task `Check if containerd config` exists uses `ansible.builtin.stat` and `registers` the result as config_file, which is then used in subsequent conditional tasks to control execution flow.
    - **(Good)** The task `Add Vagrant's SSH public keys` uses a loop with lookup('fileglob', ssh_key_pattern, wantlist=True) to iterate over multiple public key files and add each key.
    - **(Good)** The playbook uses checks such as the presence of `/etc/containerd/config.toml` before writing default configuration and uses idempotent modules ensuring repeated runs do not reset cluster state.
    - **(Excellent)** The task `Render the /etc/hosts file` uses the `ansible.builtin.template` module to generate and copy the /etc/hosts file from the hosts.j2 template onto the target VM.
    - **(Excellent)** The task `Wait for MetalLB controller to be ready` uses the `ansible.builtin.command` module to run kubectl wait with a label selector and timeout, ensuring the playbook waits until the MetalLB controller pod is ready before continuing, preventing errors due to premature execution.
    - **(Excellent)** Tasks such as `Remove SWAP from fstab` and those within Configure containerd use the `lineinfile` module with regexp to perform idempotent, regex-based edits on configuration files.

  - **(Sufficient)** the kubeconfig is also fetched to the host system using an Ansible fetch task.  
  - **(Good)** tasks use idempotent checks (`stat`, `when`, and `changed_when`) to avoid re-running setup tasks unnecessarily.  
  - **(Good)** Flannel CNI plugin is installed by applying the `kube-flannel.yml` manifest.  
  - **(Good)** join command is dynamically generated on the controller and executed on all worker nodes via delegation.

## Assignment 4

### Automated Tests

*   **Expected Level:** Excellent
*   **Implementation:**
    - **(Sufficient)** Tests follows `ML Tests Score` methodology, tests cover four aspects: Feature and Data; Model Development; ML infrastructure;
    Monitoring tests.
    - **(Sufficient)** For Feature and Data: the `test_data.py` consists of tests primarily verify the validity and quality of features and data, including checks on feature structure (e.g., sparsity, non-negativity, absence of NaNs/Infs), label correctness (e.g., binary, balanced), and data processing integrity and efficiency (e.g., matching dimensions, duplicates, preprocessing speed). For Model Development: the `test_development.py` consists of tests ensure that the trained model performs better than a simple baseline (majority class) classifier. For ML infrastructure: the `test_infrastructure.py` has test to run the DVC pipeline and verify it produces a valid model and metrics. For Monitoring: the `test_monitoring.py` has tests monitor the runtime duration and memory usage.
    - **(Sufficient)** The name of the file indicates the category of tests and there are comment for tests.
    - **(Good)** The `test_non-determinism.py` have test checks the stability of model accuracy across different random seeds, ensuring that performance does not vary much.

## Assignment 5

### Traffic Management

*   **Expected Level:** `[Your Expected Level]`
*   **Implementation:**
*   **Notes for the Grader:**

### Additional Use Case

*   **Expected Level:** `Excellent`
*   **Implementation:**
    - **(Excellent)** In `rate-limiting.yaml`, Rate limiting is configured using Istio's EnvoyFilter and a custom ConfigMap. The ratelimit-config defines a global rule that limits incoming requests to 10 per minute based on the request path. EnvoyFilters inject the Envoy Rate Limit HTTP filter into the ingress gateway and match it to the defined rules. The configuration ensures that traffic through the Istio ingress is dynamically rate-limited via a gRPC rate limit service.
