# Grading Self-Assessment

This document provides a self-assessment of our work for the Release Engineering course. Its purpose is to guide the grading process by clarifying our expected level of achievement for each rubric block, detailing where to find the implementation of specific requirements, and providing additional context for any solutions that might not be immediately obvious.

We have structured this document by assignment, with a subsection for each rubric block as defined in the course materials.
